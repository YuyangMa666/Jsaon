This exclusion means that zero is an unlikely value for the true population parameter. Therefore, we have strong evidence that the effect is different from zero, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that the observed effect is statistically significant at the chosen confidence level (e.g., 95%). This significance suggests that the effect observed in the sample is likely present in the population, beyond just random variation.In summary, a confidence interval that does not include zero provides evidence against the null hypothesis (no effect), while an interval that includes zero suggests that we cannot rule out the possibility of no effect, thus failing to reject the null hypothesis.\n"
